This is a simple implementation of the pairs trading strategy in Gatev et al (2006). 

The code dumps the results into csv files so students can analyze the strategy (and generate trade indicators) in a spreadsheet.  I'll likely add code over time allowing for trade signals (and trades) to be generated within R.
